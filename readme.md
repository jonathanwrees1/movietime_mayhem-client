movietime_mayhem-client



This is the client side of an application called "Movie Time Mayhem" which was built using React, based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

Users will be able to access information on movies, directors, and genres so
that they can learn more about movies they have watched or are interested in.

Users will also be able to create a profile so they can save data about their favorite
movies.
